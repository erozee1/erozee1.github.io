                    new situations and displayed impressive problem-solving abilities. Ethandisplayed excellent problem solving skills. 
                    One good example of this was the digitization of a seal register I had asked him to complete. Expecting it done by the end of the 2 months,
                    I was suprised to meet him the following day with the entire register completed. With excellent excel skills and some thinking outside the box
                    he impressed us all.<br><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i> <br> - Daniel Tatum (Mechanical Design Engineer)</h1>

            <h1>Many challanges arose throughout my internship. One task was to rearrange the layout of some digital readings to allow personel to access it more
                easily. Through collaboration with the shop floor staff I was able to adjust the cabinets digital twin to have a much easier to use design.
            </h1><br>
            <h1>Furthermore, I used this opportunity to reflect on what sort of role I would want after I am finished in education. From insights in the field to hand on
                experience on a fast paced machine shop floor, I was exposed to plenty of engineering disciplines. This internship fostered my passion for mechanical design
                and project management, providing a solid foundation for my future endeavours in the field.
